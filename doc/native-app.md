# Uni-App Native App Plan

This repo is an isolated G drive copy of the current web project. All native
app work lives here and does not touch the original desktop workspace.

Public repository:

```text
https://github.com/Farrran69311/qiming-uniapp-native
```

## Current Strategy

The first production path is a uni-app App shell plus the existing H5 build in
a local `web-view`.

Reasons:

- The current app depends on Vue 3, Vite, Element Plus, Three.js/VRM, PDF/Office
  preview, rich text, charts, and desktop admin layouts.
- A full native rewrite with uni components would be slower and riskier.
- `web-view` supports local HTML on App, which lets Android/iOS packages run the
  existing product while we gradually add native bridges.

The source baseline is the original `origin/agent` branch of
`Sorkai/vue-pure-admin-max`. The original desktop workspace is not modified;
this public repository is a clean G drive snapshot with native packaging layers
added on top.

Official reference points:

- `web-view` supports local sources on App and can receive `uni.postMessage`
  data from the embedded page.
- CLI can build App resources with `uni build -p app`.
- APK/IPA packaging needs HBuilderX cloud/local packaging.

## Directory Layout

- Repo root: existing Vue/Vite H5 source.
- `native-app`: uni-app shell project.
- `native-app/src/hybrid/html`: generated local H5 payload, created by
  `pnpm native:prepare`.
- `scripts/sync-app-h5.mjs`: copies `dist` into the uni-app shell and injects
  the lightweight native bridge.

## Commands

Install dependencies:

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm --dir native-app install
```

Local tools prepared on this machine:

- HBuilderX: `G:\qiming-uniapp-native-tools\HBuilderX-5.07\HBuilderX\HBuilderX.exe`
- HBuilderX CLI: `G:\qiming-uniapp-native-tools\HBuilderX-5.07\HBuilderX\cli.exe`
- ADB: `G:\qiming-uniapp-native-tools\android-sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe`
- Java: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft\jdk-21.0.11.10-hotspot\bin\java.exe`
- Android release keystore:
  `G:\qiming-uniapp-native-tools\certs\qiming-android-release.keystore`

macOS/external-SSD workspace notes:

- Keep repo clones, dependency installs, generated H5 payloads, and App build
  resources on the external SSD, for example
  `/Volumes/KINGSTON/codex-work/qiming-uniapp-native`.
- The cross-platform native helper is `scripts/native-tooling.mjs`; the npm
  commands below call it directly on macOS/Linux and still preserve the older
  PowerShell scripts for Windows-specific Android automation.
- Optional local tool overrides:
  - `QIMING_NATIVE_TOOLS_ROOT=/Volumes/KINGSTON/qiming-uniapp-native-tools`
  - `QIMING_HBUILDERX_CLI=/Applications/HBuilderX.app/Contents/MacOS/cli`
  - `QIMING_ADB=/path/to/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb`
- iOS simulator or real-device launch on macOS requires full Xcode, not only
  Command Line Tools. `pnpm native:devices` and `pnpm native:doctor` report this
  explicitly.

Build and sync local H5 into the App shell:

```powershell
pnpm native:prepare
```

Build uni-app App resources:

```powershell
pnpm --dir native-app build:app
```

Open the HBuilderX project:

```powershell
& "G:\qiming-uniapp-native-tools\HBuilderX-5.07\HBuilderX\cli.exe" open --project "G:\qiming-uniapp-native-public\native-app"
```

Convenience commands:

```powershell
pnpm native:build:android
pnpm native:build:ios
pnpm native:pack:android
pnpm native:pack:ios
pnpm native:pack:all
pnpm native:pack:init
pnpm native:pack:check
pnpm native:devices
pnpm native:run:android
pnpm native:run:ios
pnpm native:smoke
pnpm native:smoke:interactions
pnpm native:doctor
```

The Android/iOS convenience commands currently generate uni-app App resources.
The `native:pack:*` commands call the cross-platform native helper, which checks
local packaging config, injects environment-provided secrets into an ignored
temporary config, and then calls HBuilderX cloud packaging when HBuilderX CLI is
available. Final APK/IPA packaging still requires HBuilderX DCloud login and
local certificate configuration.

Run `pnpm native:doctor` before packaging. It checks the public repo state, the
local `origin/agent` source commit, preview ports, HBuilderX CLI, Java, ADB,
Android keystore, local pack config, iOS certificate files, and generated App
resources. Missing optional packaging inputs are reported as `WARN`; missing
required local tools are reported as `FAIL`.

Run `pnpm native:pack:init` once to create the ignored local
`native-app/pack-config.local.json` skeleton from the public example. Then run
`pnpm native:pack:check` before `native:pack:*`; it strictly validates the
registered DCloud AppID, Android package/certificate fields, iOS bundle/profile/
p12 fields, and manifest/config package consistency.

Run `pnpm native:devices` before real-device verification. It checks ADB,
HBuilderX Android devices, Xcode, iOS simulators, and HBuilderX iOS devices
where those tools are available. `pnpm native:run:android` keeps using the
Windows PowerShell automation when running on Windows; on macOS it reports a
manual HBuilderX fallback until Android automation is ported. `pnpm
native:run:ios` stops with a clear Xcode/HBuilderX preflight message if the host
cannot launch an iOS simulator or device.

Run `pnpm native:smoke` for repeatable mobile WebView route validation while
full iOS simulator/device validation is unavailable. The script drives the
system Chromium browser through the Chrome DevTools Protocol, uses an
isolated temporary browser profile that is removed after the run, starts the H5
dev server if port `8851` is not listening, and checks key student/teacher/admin
native routes at an iPhone-sized viewport. The default suite currently covers
36 routes: student account tabs, teacher course/discussion/exam-paper pages,
and admin course/discussion/exam-paper pages. It fails if a route stays on the
loading state, renders almost no content, misses the expected mobile layout,
bottom navigation, or page-specific mobile list selector, overflows
horizontally, or emits a new console/page error. Results are written to ignored
`native-smoke-report.json`.

Run `pnpm native:smoke:interactions` after the route smoke suite when you need
interaction-level mobile WebView coverage. It uses the same iPhone viewport and
CDP browser session, then performs real clicks for the student bottom tab bar,
student account horizontal menu, teacher bottom tab bar, and admin bottom tab
bar. Each click must update the route/query, active tab text, expected page
content, native class, and overflow checks.

Useful variants:

```powershell
pnpm native:smoke -- --roles teacher
pnpm native:smoke -- --roles student,teacher,admin --no-start
pnpm native:smoke:interactions -- --roles student,teacher
pnpm native:smoke -- --chrome "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
```

Cloud packaging config:

- Copy `native-app/pack-config.example.json` to
  `native-app/pack-config.local.json`.
- Fill Android keystore passwords and iOS certificate paths locally.
- Instead of writing certificate passwords into `pack-config.local.json`, set
  `QIMING_ANDROID_CERT_PASSWORD`, `QIMING_ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD`, and
  `QIMING_IOS_CERT_PASSWORD` in the current PowerShell session. `pack-native`
  writes those values only to an ignored temporary config and deletes it after
  the HBuilderX call.
- Instead of committing a real DCloud AppID, set `QIMING_DCLOUD_APPID` in the
  current PowerShell session. `pack-native` temporarily injects it into
  `native-app/src/manifest.json` for the HBuilderX call, then restores the
  public placeholder bytes. The current committed `__UNI__QIMING` value is only
  a local placeholder.
- `pack-config.local.json`, keystores, `.p12`, and `.mobileprovision` files are
  ignored by Git.
- Without `pack-config.local.json`, `scripts/pack-native.ps1` exits early with a
  clear setup error instead of attempting packaging.
- On macOS/Linux the same checks are available through
  `node scripts/native-tooling.mjs pack-config --mode check --platform ios`.

Live browser prototype while developing:

```powershell
pnpm native:preview
```

Manual equivalent:

```powershell
pnpm dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8851
pnpm --dir native-app dev:h5 -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8861
```

Current preview URLs:

- Teacher: `http://localhost:8861/?demoRole=teacher`
- Student: `http://localhost:8861/?demoRole=student`
- Admin: `http://localhost:8861/?demoRole=admin`

The `demoRole` switch is development-only. It exists so the native shell can be
reviewed live in a browser while code changes hot-reload. Android/iOS packaged
apps still use the normal login flow.

The native shell defaults to the full platform workbench route `/welcome/index`,
not the public landing page and not a single AI App page. Use the optional
`entry` query parameter only for targeted debugging, for example
`entry=%2Faccount%2Fai-app`; packaged APP-PLUS builds also default to
`/welcome/index`.

The H5 preview shell also renders a small bottom-right debug bar for
student/teacher/admin review and quick entry switching across workbench, AI App,
course, exam paper, student exam, and user management routes. This debug bar is
wrapped in H5-only conditional compilation and is not included in the APP-PLUS
build.

By default, the preview shell renders the app inside a 393 x 852 phone canvas so
mobile layout issues are visible while developing. The bottom-right "full
screen" toggle switches back to full browser width when wider layout inspection
is needed.

## Android Packaging Checklist

1. Install HBuilderX and sign in to a DCloud account.
2. Register or replace the placeholder appid in `native-app/src/manifest.json`.
3. Create an Android keystore.
4. Open `native-app` in HBuilderX.
5. Run发行 -> 原生App-云打包.
6. Use package name `cn.intelledu.qiming`.
7. Verify with CLI:
   - `pnpm native:devices`
   - `pnpm native:run:android`
8. Verify on a physical Android device or emulator:
   - login
   - AI streaming
   - student/teacher/admin AI app pages
   - 2D floating digital human
   - file/resource preview
   - back button and network loss state

## iOS Packaging Checklist

1. Apple Developer Program account is required.
2. Prepare Bundle ID `cn.intelledu.qiming`.
3. Prepare iOS distribution certificate `.p12`.
4. Prepare matching provisioning profile `.mobileprovision`.
5. Configure iOS privacy strings in `native-app/src/manifest.json`.
6. Install full Xcode and select it with `sudo xcode-select -s
   /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`.
7. Install HBuilderX for macOS and set `QIMING_HBUILDERX_CLI` if it is not in
   `/Applications/HBuilderX.app/Contents/MacOS/cli`.
8. Use HBuilderX cloud packaging to create IPA.
9. Upload through Transporter/App Store Connect/TestFlight.
10. Verify with CLI on a macOS-capable host:
   - `pnpm native:devices`
   - `pnpm native:run:ios`
11. Verify on a real iPhone and iPad:
   - safe area
   - keyboard input and streaming chat
   - media permissions
   - web-view cache behavior
   - App Store review risk for WebView-only shell

## Native Bridge

`pnpm native:prepare` injects:

- `uni.webview.1.5.8.js`
- `qiming-native-bridge.js`

The H5 page can call:

```js
window.QimingNativeBridge?.post({
  source: "qiming-h5",
  type: "custom-event"
});
```

The uni-app shell receives messages through the `web-view` `message` event.

## Known Blockers

- The public GitHub repo has been created and pushed from a clean root commit.
- Java, ADB, and HBuilderX are now installed/prepared locally, but no Android
  device was connected during verification.
- HBuilderX CLI publish/cloud packaging currently reports "this feature needs
  login". A DCloud account login is required before APK/IPA cloud packaging can
  run.
- GitHub 到 CNB 的自动同步工作流已恢复，但真实自动发布仍依赖 GitHub `CNB_TOKEN`
  和 CNB 侧 `EDGEONE_API_TOKEN` / `EDGEONE_PAGES_NAME` 配置齐全。
- iOS IPA packaging cannot be fully finished without Apple certificates.

## Verification Log

2026-06-13:

- Work moved to the external SSD clone at
  `/Volumes/KINGSTON/codex-work/qiming-uniapp-native` to avoid using the
  internal Mac disk for repo, dependency, and build artifacts.
- Added `scripts/native-tooling.mjs` as the cross-platform native helper for
  `native:doctor`, `native:devices`, `native:preview`, `native:pack:*`, and
  `native:run:*`.
- `scripts/sync-app-h5.mjs` now validates the generated hybrid target path with
  the host path separator, so `pnpm native:prepare` can run on macOS as well as
  Windows.
- The native shell default entry was aligned with the documented workbench
  route `/welcome/index`.
- The injected native bridge now adds iOS/Android platform classes inside
  Html5Plus WebViews and applies a small iOS scroll/keyboard compatibility
  guard without changing the product UI.
- `node --check scripts/native-tooling.mjs` and
  `node --check scripts/sync-app-h5.mjs` passed.
- `pnpm native:doctor` passed as a diagnostic command and reported `2 OK`, `13
  WARN`, `0 FAIL` on the current Mac. Real iOS blockers are missing HBuilderX
  CLI, missing `.p12`/`.mobileprovision`, placeholder DCloud AppID, no local
  pack config, missing App build resources, and full Xcode not installed.
- `pnpm native:devices` passed as a diagnostic command and reported `0 OK`, `4
  WARN`, `0 FAIL`; this Mac currently has only Command Line Tools, so `simctl`
  is unavailable.
- `pnpm native:pack:check` correctly failed in strict mode because
  `native-app/pack-config.local.json` has not been created.
- `pnpm native:run:ios -- --skip-prepare` correctly failed before launch with a
  full-Xcode requirement message.

2026-06-09:

- `pnpm exec vue-tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` passed for the copied H5 app.
- `pnpm native:prepare` passed and generated `native-app/src/hybrid/html`.
- `pnpm --dir native-app type-check` passed.
- `pnpm --dir native-app build:app` passed and generated
  `native-app/dist/build/app`.
- Generated App resources include:
  - `hybrid/html/index.html`
  - `hybrid/html/qiming-native-bridge.js`
  - `hybrid/html/uni.webview.1.5.8.js`
- HBuilderX 5.07 was downloaded from DCloud and opened with the native app
  project.
- ADB 37.0.0 was installed from Android platform-tools; no device was attached.
- Public GitHub repo push succeeded on `main`.
- `.github/workflows/sync-to-cnb.yml` was removed and pushed.
- The native H5 preview shell is running on `http://localhost:8861/` and embeds
  the copied H5 dev server on `http://localhost:8851/`.
- `pnpm exec vue-tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` passed after adding the
  development-only `demoRole` preview bootstrap.
- `pnpm --dir native-app type-check` passed after simplifying the native shell.
- `pnpm native:prepare` passed again and regenerated the local App H5 payload.
- `pnpm --dir native-app build:app` passed again and generated App resources.
- Build warnings remain for legacy unresolved image/font references and large
  chunks in the original web app; they do not block App resource generation.
- HBuilderX CLI project import succeeded for
  `G:\qiming-uniapp-native-public\native-app`.
- `cli publish app-android --type appResource` and
  `cli publish app-ios --type appResource` were attempted; both stopped at the
  DCloud login requirement.
- A local Android release keystore was generated outside the repo. SHA256:
  `4D:70:6E:E2:2E:88:3F:46:AB:B6:9C:C7:12:F6:BA:7A:3D:17:CC:4C:8F:8B:DD:0C:92:29:18:06:2B:44:FF:6D`.
- The live native H5 preview now includes a bottom-right student/teacher/admin
  switcher for visual review while developing. `pnpm --dir native-app
  type-check` and `pnpm --dir native-app build:app` passed after this change.
- The live preview shell now defaults to a 393 x 852 phone canvas with a
  full-screen toggle. Browser inspection confirmed the iframe and device frame
  are `393x852` at `http://localhost:8861/?demoRole=teacher`.
- `pnpm --dir native-app type-check` passed after the phone-canvas preview
  change.
- `pnpm --dir native-app build:app` passed after the phone-canvas preview
  change.
- `scripts/pack-native.ps1 -Platform android -SkipPrepare` was tested without a
  local config and correctly stopped at the missing `pack-config.local.json`
  setup requirement.
- `pnpm native:preview` was added and tested. When the H5 and uni-app shell
  preview servers are already running, it reuses ports `8851` and `8861` and
  prints `http://localhost:8861/?demoRole=teacher`.
- `pnpm exec vue-tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck`, `pnpm --dir native-app
  type-check`, and `pnpm --dir native-app build:app` passed after adding the
  preview launcher.
- `pnpm native:doctor` was added and tested. The first run during this
  documentation update reported `10 OK`, `5 WARN`, `0 FAIL`: HBuilderX/Java/
  Keytool/ADB, preview ports, Android keystore, source `origin/agent`, and App
  resources are ready. The dirty working tree WARN is temporary during edits;
  the real packaging WARNs are DCloud login verification, no Android device
  attached, missing `pack-config.local.json`, and missing iOS
  `.p12`/`.mobileprovision`.
- `pnpm --dir native-app type-check` and `pnpm --dir native-app build:app`
  passed after adding the native doctor diagnostics.
- Browser inspection confirmed `http://localhost:8861/?demoRole=teacher`
  renders the phone preview shell, with a `395x854` device frame and a `393x852`
  iframe loading `http://localhost:8851/#/account/ai-app?demoRole=teacher`.
- `pnpm native:pack:init` was tested and created the ignored local
  `native-app/pack-config.local.json`; `git check-ignore` confirmed the file is
  ignored by `native-app/.gitignore`.
- `pnpm native:pack:check` was tested in strict mode and correctly fails before
  packaging while the registered DCloud AppID, Android keystore passwords, and
  iOS profile/p12/password are still missing.
- `scripts/pack-native.ps1 -Platform android -SkipPrepare` now runs the strict
  pack config check first and stops before HBuilderX packaging when WARN/FAIL
  items remain.
- `pnpm --dir native-app type-check` and `pnpm --dir native-app build:app`
  passed after adding the pack config lifecycle scripts.
- `pnpm native:doctor` reports `10 OK`, `6 WARN`, `0 FAIL` during this update.
  After the temporary dirty working tree WARN is removed by commit, the real
  remaining WARNs are DCloud/HBuilderX login verification, no Android device,
  placeholder DCloud AppID, placeholder local pack config values, and missing
  iOS certificate/profile files.
- Android certificate passwords can now be supplied through
  `QIMING_ANDROID_CERT_PASSWORD` and `QIMING_ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD` without
  writing secrets into `pack-config.local.json`. Android-only pack config
  validation with those temporary environment variables reports the password
  field as `configured via env` and leaves only the DCloud AppID WARN.
- `pack-native` now uses an ignored `pack-config.effective.tmp.json` only for
  the HBuilderX call and removes it in `finally`; verification confirmed the
  temporary file does not remain after a blocked packaging attempt.
- Browser inspection confirmed the live preview still renders the teacher phone
  shell at `http://localhost:8861/?demoRole=teacher`, with a `395x854` device
  frame and `393x852` iframe.
- The native shell default entry was changed from `/account/ai-app` to `/home`
  so the uni-app container previews and packages the whole agent-branch
  platform by default. Browser inspection confirmed
  `http://localhost:8861/?demoRole=teacher&entry=%2Fhome` loads
  `http://localhost:8851/#/home?demoRole=teacher&v=0`, while the optional
  `entry=%2Faccount%2Fai-app` override still routes to the AI App page for
  focused debugging.
- `pnpm native:devices` was added and tested. Current result is `1 OK`,
  `3 WARN`, `0 FAIL`: HBuilderX CLI is present, Android has no attached
  device, HBuilderX returns no Android device, and iOS device/simulator launch
  is not available on this Windows host.
- `pnpm native:run:android` and `scripts/run-native.ps1 -Platform android
  -SkipPrepare` were tested without an Android device and now stop during
  device preflight, before `native:prepare` and before HBuilderX launch, with a
  clear "No Android device attached" message. `scripts/run-native.ps1 -Platform
  ios -SkipPrepare` stops early on Windows with an iOS host/tooling message.
- `pnpm --dir native-app type-check` and `pnpm --dir native-app build:app`
  passed after adding the device/run scripts, and browser inspection reconfirmed
  the full platform `/home` preview iframe.
- `QIMING_DCLOUD_APPID` support was added for pack config validation and
  HBuilderX packaging. Android-only validation with temporary AppID and signing
  password environment variables reports `9 OK`, `0 WARN`, `0 FAIL`.
- `scripts/pack-native.ps1 -Platform android -SkipPrepare -DryRun` was tested
  with temporary AppID/signing environment variables. It generated the effective
  config, temporarily injected the AppID into `native-app/src/manifest.json`,
  restored the manifest byte-for-byte, and removed
  `pack-config.effective.tmp.json`.
- The native shell default entry was changed from the public landing page
  `/home` to the full platform workbench `/welcome/index`. Browser inspection
  confirmed `http://localhost:8861/?demoRole=teacher` loads
  `http://localhost:8851/#/welcome/index?demoRole=teacher&v=0`.
- The live H5 preview now includes an H5-only quick entry switcher for
  workbench, AI App, course, exam paper, student exam, and user management
  routes. Browser inspection confirmed these focused entries route through the
  uni-app shell:
  - teacher AI App:
    `http://localhost:8851/#/account/ai-app?demoRole=teacher&v=0`
  - teacher exam paper:
    `http://localhost:8851/#/exam-paper/index?demoRole=teacher&v=0`
  - student exam center:
    `http://localhost:8851/#/student-exam-center/list?demoRole=student&v=0`
  - admin user list:
    `http://localhost:8851/#/user/list?demoRole=admin&v=0`
- `pnpm --dir native-app type-check`, `pnpm exec vue-tsc --noEmit
  --skipLibCheck`, and `pnpm --dir native-app build:app` passed after the full
  platform preview entry update.
- The Android native launch path now refreshes the HBuilderX 15.07 debug base by
  default, clears native build output, and then relaunches the current app
  resource bundle. This prevents stale 5.01 resources from being reused by the
  5.07 mobile SDK. Use `scripts/run-native.ps1 -KeepBaseApk` only when the
  installed base APK must be preserved.
- Android emulator validation after the base refresh passed with
  `scripts/run-native.ps1 -Platform android -DeviceId emulator-5554 -EntryPath
  /home -SkipPrepare`: the runtime loaded `hybrid/html/index.html#/home`, logs
  reported `weexjsb:15.07`, and no HBuilderX 5.01/5.07 mismatch dialog appeared.
  The captured verification screen is `native-after-base-refresh.png`.
- Physical-device validation is still blocked on this Windows host because ADB
  and HBuilderX only see `emulator-5554`. Windows detects the connected
  Huawei/Honor USB composite device with problem code 39, so the phone is not
  currently usable by the native launch script until the USB/HDB/ADB driver layer
  is repaired.
